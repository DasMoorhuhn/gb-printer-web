## Using a WebUSB or WebSerial device:
After connecting a WebUSB or WebSerial device, you can continue to the [Gallery Page](#/gallery) or [Home Page](#/home) now.  
An overlay will appear once you're receiving data.  
You can also access these options via the USB-Symbol in the navigation and the [Settings Page](#/settings).  

## Note: WebUSB and Web Serial are similar but not the same:
* While Web Serial has access to a regular COM-port and does not require special devices, the feature is not available on mobile devices.
* WebUSB requires certain microcontrollers where the processor has direct access to the USB interface (e.g. an Arduino Leonardo). See [webusb for arduino on GitHub](https://github.com/webusb/arduino) for more information.
